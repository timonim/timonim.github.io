        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Creating an obituary for a loved family member was a sensitive yet
          necessary task that left me unsatisfied with the existing solutions
          available online. Many websites offered clunky interfaces or lacked
          the design and cultural sensitivity needed to honor my loved one's
          memory appropriately.

          To create a successful online obituary generator, it's essential to
          establish foundational requirements that cater to users seeking a
          pleasant and user-friendly solution for creating an obituary. My

          Navigating Development <br class="mobile-only" />
          as a Designer
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a designer stepping into the world of development, a project like
          this is a challenge. To streamline the process, I adopted Git for
          version control, effectively managing my design iterations, merging
          code updates, and keeping a well-organized project structure. By
          embracing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to create an appealing
          user interface and add interactivity while continuously improving the
          generator's functionality – all from the perspective of a designer
          making their foray into development.

      <div class="project-paragraph">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>
          To overcome these challenges, I set out to design and develop an
          obituary generator that catered to both user experience and the
          nuances of the culture. By focusing on creating an intuitive
          interface, I aimed to provide a simple yet elegant solution for people
          looking to create meaningful tributes for their loved ones.

        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>
          Having built a strong foundation for my online obituary generator, I
          now aim to broaden its scope and create a more inclusive platform. By
          focusing on customizing the design and functionality of the tool to
          cater to various obituary types – religious, cultural, or personal
          preferences – I ensure that every user can create a meaningful,
          fitting tribute using my online obituary generator, no matter their
          specific needs.
