        <h2>Medical Cannabis</h2>
        <p class="description">
          As a designer at David and Yosef, I focused on creating and designing
          cannabis products for Israel's leading medical cannabis company,
          Pharmocann. My specialization included developing and re-imagining a
          variety of products such as oils, pre-rolls, inflorescences, and even
          the product catalog itself.

          Adapting packaging designs to comply with printing restrictions and
          regulatory demands mandated by the governing body can be a complex
          process, especially in the highly regulated cannabis industry. The
          challenge involves ensuring that the design meets all necessary
          requirements, while still maintaining a visually appealing and
          effective product.

      <h3>Packaging Re-branding</h3>

      <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="item1" id="text-with-max-width">
          As the lead designer for Pharmocann's rebranding project, I was
          responsible for revitalizing their existing product line to better
          appeal to a growing recreational audience. To remain competitive in a
          highly contested market, Pharmocann recognized the need to revamp
          their branding strategy, and I led the effort to achieve this goal.

          The project involved careful consideration of market trends, consumer
          preferences, and brand identity. The rebranding required analysis of
          competitors and new opportunities in the market to target Pharmocann's
          rebranding efforts.

      <h3>Product Catalog</h3>
      <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="item1" id="text-with-max-width-50">
          Producing an informative brochure was an important part of reaching
          out to prospective cannabis patients who were unfamiliar with the
          treatment option. Many of the intended readers would be in difficult
          circumstances or turning to cannabis out of necessity, rather than
          choice. <br /><br />
          The brochure I created required careful image editing, styled text,
          layout and print design suited to this audience. The aim was to
          welcome people who were new or inexperienced with cannabis as a
          treatment, helping them understand their options in an accessible way.
          The design needed to convey approachability and compassion for readers
          who may be struggling.
